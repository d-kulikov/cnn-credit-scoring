Credit scoring based on raw credit bureau data

Credit bureau data is provided at a loan (account) level. It usually requires complex aggregation and extensive feature engineering to produce meaningful indicators at a customer level. However, LSTM neural networks and Convolutional neural networks provide an opportunity to use raw credit bureau data directly. This project demonstrates how to represent credit bureau data as a timeseries or 2-dimensional matrix in order to estimate creditworthiness of a particular customer.
